  they are input or return values (in, out, inout.)
  The IDL and Ada generators use this in their generated code.

* Ability to show only public methods/members in diagram.

* Improvements to scaled printing.

* Crisp new icons

  such an "ancient" KDE version the new compressed-XMI file
  format will not work.

                -- folders and multiple umlobjects (selected from the listview)
                -- folders, multiple umlobjects and umlviews (selected from the listview)
